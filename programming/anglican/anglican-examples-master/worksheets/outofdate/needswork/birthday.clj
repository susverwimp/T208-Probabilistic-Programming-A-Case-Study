;;; Answering a question like “Approximately, what’s the probability that in a room filled with 23 people at least one pair of people have the same birthday?” is straightforward. All one needs to do is generate the underlying phenomena and then pose a question that computes the quantity of interest from the generated data.
;;; 
;;; To find out the approximate probability of a pair or more sharing the same birthday we need a model that generates birthdays. A simple and reasonably accurate model encodes the assumption that birthdays are generated independently for all people uniformly over the set of days in a year. The hardest part of answering the question is writing the function to compute the answer to the question of interest.
