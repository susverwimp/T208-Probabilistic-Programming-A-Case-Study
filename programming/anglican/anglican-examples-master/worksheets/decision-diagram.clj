;;; # Decision Making Under Uncertainty
;;; 
;;; Model-based decision making involves building models/simulators of the world, observing features of the world, assigning a utility value to every action in every state of the world, then rationally selecting an action based on maximizing the expected utility under updated beliefs about the state of the world given the observations that have been made.  Multi-stage Bayesian decisions problems can be expressed using a graphical notation known as decision or influence diagrams (Murphy, 2012). These diagrams extend traditional graphical models with the addition of decision or action nodes, represented by rectangles, and utility nodes represented by diamonds.  Encoding such decision problems as Anglican programs is straightforward as we will show now.

;;; 
;;; ## Example
;;; 
;;; The oil wildcatter problem is a well-known  decision making problem that can be expressed and solved using influence diagrams [(Raiffa, 1968)](http://facweb.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/pviton/courses/crp6600/raiffa_Chs_012.pdf) and [(Shenoy, 1992)](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/183/1/OR92.pdf). This example also appears in (Murphy, 2012) which is where we have derived this from.
;;; 
;;; In this problem an oil wildcatter must decide either to drill or not to drill. He is uncertain whether the well will be dry, wet or soaking in oil. The wildcatter may also make seismic soundings that will help determine the nature of the well.  Figure 1 demonstrates shows an evolution of the oil wildcatter decision-making problems  that starts with no measurement then adds a sounding, and finally terminates with including the cost of conducting the test.
;;; 
;;; As usual we will start with boilerplace inclusions.

;;; There is no inference in this example, it's merely a simulation of the world and a computation of the expected utility under uncertainty about the world.  If we are able to make measurements relating to the state of the world then we should update our belief about the state of the world by performing posterior inference.  
;;; 
;;; Making such an observation is be found in figure 1b). Suppose now that the wildcatter performs a sounding to estimate the state of the well in advance of drilling. The soundings will give a closed reflection pattern (indication for a lot of oil, @@s=2@@ (:closed), an open pattern (indication for some oil, @@s=1@@ (:open)), or a diffuse pattern  (almost no hope for oil, @@s=0@@ (:diffuse)). As can be seen in figure 1b), an information arc has been added from Sound to Drill, indicating that the sounding information is available before the wildcatter decides to drill or not. The reliability of the sensor is measured using a conditional distribution table for @@p(s|o)@@.
;;; 
;;; Suppose that the wildcatter observes an open reflection pattern @@s=0@@ (:open) from the sounding, indicating that it is unlikely that there is black gold beneath.  The computation that has to happen is the computation of the posterior distribution over worlds and the conditional expectation of the utility of each action.  This code does this via the _observe_ directive which informs Anglican to compute the posterior distribution of the utilities given that a diffuse observation was made.
